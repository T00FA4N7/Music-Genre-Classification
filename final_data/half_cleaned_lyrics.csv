Adestria,1984,"These manmade morals like perfectly paved sidewalks
Force direction and safety as they watch us like hawks
They teach us to walk with blinders
Like the horses they wish we were
To carry their causes on our backs
Without questioning what theyre for


We simply nod and agree we are bred to be lazy
They set the world on fire and we are the gasoline
Were told to accept these given proofs
Were fed a diet of lies and unproven truths


I know that weve been herded together
To be different leaves us alone
Theyve put our minds to sleep our dreams are not our own
Like a thief they came in the night
To remove our will to fight


We simply nod and agree we are bred to be lazy
They set the world on fire and we are the gasoline
Were told to accept these given proofs
Were fed a diet of lies and unproven truths

They sit above cast judgment down
Offer no help to those that will surely drown
They cast me out cause I dont feel the same
Im not content to leave the world aflame
And if to stand for something thats not a trend
Leads me to my end
Then Ill smile as I leave
Because I fought for something I believe1",metal

Anne-Marie,2002,"I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No its never been better than the summer
Of 2002 Ooh


We were only eleven
But acting like grownups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing Love is forever and ever
Well I guess that was true Ooh


Dancin on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this say


Oops I got 99 problems singin bye bye bye
Hold up if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me baby one more time uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young uh
Singin at the top of both our lungs
See AnneMarie LiveGet tickets as low as 56
Now were under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah we are all we need
When were holdin each other
Im taken back to 2002 Ooh

Born Of Osiris,A Mind Short Circuiting,"Lightning strikes you twice
As the thunder roars As the thunder roars
Synchronicities this faithful chapter
These stories will be everlasting

Stuck inside a slow storm
A mind short circuiting
A mind short circuiting
Tossed around like inanimate objects
Upside down
Stuck inside a slow storm
A mind short circuiting
A glitch in the matrix

Confine
The wish you made was incomplete

Each layer brings corruption
Leads closer to the end
My codex reads disruption
How far will I descend

Dark clouds of pouring rain
Wrapped in a cyclone
Falling out Im going insane
Slow storm relentless pain
Short circuiting
Blistered winds
Nothing remains
Stuck inside a slow storm
A mind short circuiting
A mind short circuiting
Tossed around like inanimate objects
Upside down
Stuck inside a slow storm
A mind short circuiting
A glitch in the matrix

Dark clouds of pouring rain
Wrapped in a cyclone
Falling out Im going insane
Slow storm relentless pain
Short circuiting
Blistered winds
Nothing remains

Its like I told you
Words as weapons feeling like a wound a sunk in knife
Corrupted programs made by manic ways we lose our lives
We lose our lives
We try to stay alive
A storm inside
Just trying to survive
Words as weapons feeling like a wound a sunk in knife
Corrupted programs made by manic ways we lose our lives",metal

But thats the way I like it baby I dont wanna live forever

Chance the Rapper,Acid Rain,"Kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatchless necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah I inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young just turned older than him
I seen it happen I seen it happen I see it always
He still be screaming I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And Im hungry Im just not that thirsty
As of late all my verses seem not so versey
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back like Thats not your jersey
Stressin pullin my hair out hoping I dont get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I dont get sick
Making all of this money hoping I dont get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth dont rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls is that appealing to you
From your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Couldve threw him an alleyoop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vics still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that antiviolence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And Im only getting greedier
And Im still Mr Youmedia
And I still cant find Talent
And Im still choosing classmates that wouldnt fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think Im good enough
And Mama Jan still dont take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

I am a new man I am sanctified
Oh I am holy I have been baptized
I have been born again I am the White Light

Tomaso Albinoni,Adagio in G Minor,"We can invent Kingdoms of our own
Grand purple thrones those chairs of lust
 love we must in beds of rust
Steel doors lock in prisoners screams
 muzak AM rocks their dreams
No black mens pride to hoist the beams
While mocking angels sift what seems
To be a collage of magazine dust
Scratched on foreheads of walls of trust
This is just jail for those who must
Get up in the morning  fight for such
Unusable standards
While weeping maidens
Showoff penury  pout

Then you put your charms around me

On a night so warm and tender
We stare into each others eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most would treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

And this is not our fate
So let us stop talking falsely now

While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too well uh

A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl hey

You got in my head with the things that you said
And you left me a mess now to top it off

Look in the mirror dont want to
Youre keeping me down for your debut
But your reign is through

All my life I was breathing smoke

You work your way into my lungs
Like a virus in the air
A simple plague cant cut me off
Ill nevr fall in line just to suffocate

When my minds runnin wild I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard the crazy things the voices tell me to do
But its no use
I tried to own it write songs about it
Believe me Ive tried in the end I needed to breathe
Find inspiration some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me me


All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment every second every trespass
Every awful thing every broken dream
A couple years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head gainst the wall tryna put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room alone in a room


I saw the world a couple of times tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole and my mind kept playin tricks on me
Feelin older every day took everything I had to not crash and burn
But Im starting to learn
Sometimes Ill fall down sometimes Ill lose hope
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely but I aint alone here
So I keep pushin the limits of what makes me me

Broken promises collapse
Bodies lay like shattered glass
Hold the pieces feel how nothing ever lasts
With tunnel vision fading in
How Ive thirsted for the end
Pull me closer till Im in over my head


We are broken bodies bound for ach other
In the impact we bcome antimatter
The dust hasnt settled but we feel the decay
Torn limb from limb I am swearing your name
Our hands collide we brace together
In the impact we become antimatter

Were waiting in the wreckage
Were waiting in the wreckage
Were waiting in the wreckage for the sun to rise
Im staring at the fractures no one else can see theyre so complete
When morning comes will there be anyone left to find
My vision starts to surrender as colors subvert the night


Stolen by auroras our bodies realign
Magnetic in the impulse show me the other side
Suspended in the ether till I felt you in my chest
I know were not alone but Im in over my head


We are broken bodies bound for each other

The dust hasnt settled but we feel the decay
Torn limb from limb I am swearing your name

Talking bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move


Oh but you were so shy so was I
Maybe thats why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me


Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I like you a lot
But youre about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what


It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later Id have to ask for your hand


So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I love you a lot
I think weve got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not



So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon

And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle



When the preacher man said Say I do
I did and you did too

Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not


Are we gonna do this or what
Look at all the love that we got
It aint never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not


Yeah baby I love you a lot

I really think weve got a shot

Are you gonna kiss me or not",Country

Charm the Riot,Arm Or A Leg,"Henry Dobbins was a good man and a superb soldier but sophistication was not his strong suit The ironies went beyond him In many ways he was like America itself big and strong full of good intentions a roll of fat jiggling at his belly slow of foot but always plodding along always there when you needed him a believer in the virtues of simplicity and directness and hard labor Like his country too Dobbins was drawn toward sentimentality
Even now twenty years later I can see him wrapping his girlfriends pantyhose around his neck before heading out on ambush
It was his one eccentricity The pantyhose he said had the properties of a goodluck charm He liked putting his nose into the nylon and breathing in the scent of his girlfriends body he liked the memories this inspired he sometimes slept with the stockings up against his face the way an infant sleeps with a flannel blanket secure and peaceful More than anything though the stockings were a talisman for him They kept him safe They gave access to a spiritual world where things were soft and intimate a place where he might someday take his girlfriend to live Like many of us in Vietnam Dobbins felt the pull of superstition and he believed firmly and absolutely in the protective power of the stockings They were like body armor he thought Whenever we saddled up for a latenight ambush putting on our helmets and flak jackets Henry Dobbins would make a ritual out of arranging the nylons around his neck carefully tying a knot draping the two leg sections over his left shoulder There were some jokes of course but we came to appreciate the mystery of it all Dobbins was invulnerable Never wounded never a scratch In August he tripped a Bouncing Betty which failed to detonate And a week later he got caught in the open during a fierce little firefight no cover at all but he just slipped the pantyhose over his nose and breathed deep and let the magic do its work
It turned us into a platoon of believers You dont dispute facts
But then near the end of October his girlfriend dumped him It was a hard blow Dobbins went quiet for a while staring down at her letter then after a time he took out the stockings and tied them around his neck as a comforter
No sweat he said The magic doesnt go away",hiphop

So Im trying to do my best
To make something outta nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I dont even know what city Im at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I dont recall
Its like my lifes on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldnt be long
That was last November now Decembers almost gone
Id apologize but I dont realize what Im doing wrong

And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew to coop but you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing you
Cause theyd a just been over it
Let em talk let em talk let em talk let em talk
Like we dont hear what they saying
Let em walk let em walk let em walk let em walk
Well just drive by and keep waving
Cause you and I above all that
Just let em wallow in it
Now they all choked up yuck
Cause they be swallowing it

Sittin lookin pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin star

How long can you hold the weight

Has left me gasping for air

And Im afraid of who I turned out to be
Now I know these roots have taken hold of me

Unsure of what comes next
Panting on the slopes
Chaos unmatched
As the journey unfolds
This was doomed all along
The river poisoned at the source
Im sick of cutting heads
And watch them grow to haunt me again
This time I aim for the heart

Unwilling to see senseless
So blinded by selfishness
Only focusing on myself
And ignoring anyone else
Becoming driven by despair
Feeling trapped into a corner
Losing more and more of reality
Perceiving all the hurt only onesidedly


Have you ever been blinded by the pain
Losing yourself inside the heartache


Losing yourself
Feeling too powerless to change
Stuck and unable to escape
Incapable to see another way
I need someone to shake me to wake me
I dont even need full clarity
Just to start the shift from blind to blurry

Have you ever been blinded by the pain
Losing yourself inside the heartache
And does that mean we cannot change
Or will we always be seen that way


Will we always be seen that way
And does that really mean we have not changed


Or does it only mean
The truth is not in how were seen
But in the actions that
Were now determined to take
Revealing the new path
We chose to mend the heartache
Was it a pattern or a disastrous mistake
Is the truth in what you see or what I say


Have you ever been blinded by the pain
Losing yourself inside the heartache
And does that mean we cannot change
Or will we always be seen that way

Be seen that way
Blinded by pain Blinded by the pain


And does that really mean we have not changed",metal

Telling stories if we had one
Someone fired the old jukebox up
The song sure was a sad one
A teardrop rolled down Bubbas nose
From the pain the song was inflicting
And all at once he jumped to his feet
Just like somebody kicked him


Bubba shot the jukebox last night
Said it played a sad song that made him cry
Went to his truck and got a fortyfive
Bubba shot the jukebox last night


Bubba aint never been accused
Of being mentality stable
So we did not draw an easy breath
Until he laid that colt on the table
He hung his head till the cops showed up
They dragged him right out of Margies
Told him Dont you play dumb with us son
You know damn well what the charge is

Bubba shot the jukebox last night
Said it played a sad song that made him cry
Went to his truck and got a fortyfive
Well he shot the jukebox last night


Well the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on
The confrontation was a tense one
Shook his head and said Bubba Boy
You was always a dense one
A reckless discharge of a gun
Thats what the officers are claiming
Bubba hollered Reckless Hell
I hit just where I was aiming


Bubba shot the jukebox last night
Said it played a sad song that made him cry
Went to his truck and got a fortyfive
Well he shot the jukebox
Stopped it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox last night


Well he could not tell right from wrong
Through the teardrops in his eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
It was justifiable homicide

Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug

Billy Ocean,Caribbean Queen (No More Love On the Run),"Shes simply awesome
Ooh


She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name yeah
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame


Caribbean Queen
Now were sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run


I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you cant ignore
And passion burns you like never before


I was in search of a good time
Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind

Caribbean Queen
Now were sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run


Caribbean Queen
Now were sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

The Wise Man's Fear,Carry On,"As we all wait here
Lurking with the shadows
In this dead atmosphere
Watching blood form frost
We left in search of answers
How did we become so lost


All we have is this fight against the wind and fire in our bones Bones
Now it seems that with darker days before us
Through terror
We carry on carry on


Another daybreak
Another night awake
Too horrified to move
But unable to remain in this place
I take a moment to collect myself
Before my heart succumbs to this hate


Each step treading a blanket of bones
Nothing more than the shards of a dire past
Each day threading a new needle
Stitching up visions of the curses we cast

All we have is this fight against the wind and fire in our bones Bones
Now it seems that with darker days before us
Through terror
We carry on carry on
Growing numb from standing in the sun
To fight against the shadow
You sacrifice the light from your heart
Now it seems that with darker days before us
Through terror
We carry on carry on


All these years spiraling
Spent tempering vengeance with insanity
All these years spiraling
Spent tempering vengeance with insanity
Oh a birthright of fire
Wrung from the land that time had forgot
Oh a deepseated terror
The road to oblivion is paved with those lost


All we have is this fight against the wind and fire in our bones Our bones
Now it seems that with darker days before us
Through terror
We carry on carry on
We carry on we carry on we carry on
Growing numb from standing in the sun
To fight against the shadow
You sacrifice the light from your heart
Now it seems that with darker days before us
Through terror
We carry on carry on

Our birthright is fire
Doomed to wander the land that time had forgot
Existence is terror
A road to oblivion paved with the lost",metal

I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell


Next day I chased her round the playground
Across the monkey bars to the merrygoround
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote


Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes check yes or no


Now were grown up and shes my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Aint much changed I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room


Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together she still gets to me

Hendy,Cheers,"Wasnt born a optimist but this life made me one
I was taken from my mother shit I wasnt even one
Not to sound mean but that bitch she was crazy dumb
Who does drugs when they are pregnant with they baby son
Anyway I was taken to my aunts
Its crazy what we dont remember how it still haunts us
Five pounds just tryna survive
But I was taken away why Reason for failure to thrive
By arrived Im revived
Landed in that foster care
Cant explain the love that was offered there
My friend I love you I know you tried hard
Then you had a lot to deal with
Honestly you aint have enough cards
Age six thats when my life started
When Hendersin was born and nickles was just a daily departed
Thats probably why I come so highly regarded
And I  rather die broke than to live broken hearted


Time to make a toast
Cause we so close
And our dreams never far away
No they cant see
Everything well be
And theres really nothing left to say no
So sing cheers yeah yeah
Sing cheers yeah yeah

Perfectionist tryna find out what the question is sing cheers
A real family to love and to teach
Failure I had to get past the preach
Highschool it was a pleasure
Gettin drunk and using sports as a measure
Or your selfworth didnt put myself first endlessly
Said Im leaving school my dad became my enemy
Soon music became the remedy anecdote
Funny he went from being the man who wont support me
To surely knowing that I am blowing
To the point I probably need a life jacket and a boat
My way or the highway it took the toll
They took me for granted but they would never take my soul
My family that I cherish my girl that I love
Irreplaceable fans just raise your glass above


Time to make a toast
Cause we so close
And our dreams never far away
No they cant see
Everything well be

Nothing will change until it drains aint nothing the same uh
Cause you become like the blood in my veins
Saying Im way too young to be stuck on the rain
And still its peak weeks til I figured out you played keys
Eighteen you been listening to Jay Dee
Blaming the bait trees telling me you hate these Gs
But didnt need me telling you they aint me
Because they aint me uh they aint me
Dont need to know about the colours that they paint me

Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her hed take her for his bride

Dont sweat the technique


Lets trace the hits and check the file
Lets see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they cant get foul
At least not now itll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass til MCs get weak
For every word they trace its a scar they keep
Cause when I speak they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in 86
With a melody and a Presidents mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Parties clubs in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MCs wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique


Dont sweat the technique
Dont sweat the technique

They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped and wrecked
But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering whats next
Pieces are took to labs to observe em
They couldnt absorb em they didnt deserve em
My ideas are only for the audiences ears
For my opponents it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
Im also a sculpture formed with structure
Because of my culture Im equipped to construct the
Technical styles thatll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You dont have to speak just seek
And peep the technique


Never sweat the technique


I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poems physique never weak or obsolete
They never grow old techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new cause its real
And in a while the stylell have much more value
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful never irrelevant mathematical
Heres some soothing souvenirs
For all the years you fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
Its cool when you freak to the beat
But dont sweat the technique

Never sweat the technique
Dont sweat the technique
Dont sweat the technique15",hiphop

Should be the one behind the wheel

Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine

David Lee Murphy,Dust On The Bottle,"Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
He made homemade wine like nobody I know
I dropped by one Friday night and said Can you help me Creole
I got a little girl waiting on me and I want to treat her right


He said I got what you need son as we sat down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said


There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time


You were sitting in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My old heart was racing as you climbed inside
You slid over real close as we drove down to the lake road
And watched the sun fade in that big red sky


I reached under the front seat and said Now heres something special
Its just been waiting for a night like tonight

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time


Youre still with me
Weve made some memories
After all these years
Theres one thing Ive found
Some say good love
Is like a fine wine
It keeps getting better
As the days go by


There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool you about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that gets sweeter with time

A mystery to man
Circling the universe in tandem
Just out of reach out of reach
Because we beat upon on a wall
Instead of the door there is no answer
Are we destined to be on our own

Im right up to bat
Its a DAISY Age and youre about to walk topstage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat

Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a oneman sport
And whos better for this than Plug One Plug One
Now dont worry about me squashin other deals
Cause theyve already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
Youll stay with me I know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that Im Posdnuos
But because


I know Ill love you better


May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The names Plug Two Is Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
Cause it takes two not three to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
Its true True

I know Ill love you better


Now its time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and well pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
Well make Campbells Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug Ones within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing In full swing
I show this in gifts words or letters
But even without those three
I know youll be close to me cause


I know Ill love you better

Its I again and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend til we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin well hit the Top Ten
Then we can meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin The wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a Gclef
My dear I claim youre deaf
And if you can hear me by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you possess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

Into someone elses pocket then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down

Im on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books trying to stay hip
Im thinking of you and youre out there so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Ooh
Oohoohooh ooh


Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why I dont despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once so alive and new
But its gone from your eyes
Id better realise

Dont turn your back on me

So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that Im not

I cant feel the way I did before

Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me
You say youve turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it down for someone else
Cause loving him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby cant you see
That hes
Not me


And I need you
To know you can
Fall into me
That my arms
Are wide open and
Will always be
Right here waiting
Staying strong
Come and
Fall into me

Ill follow any road
Anywhere to get to you
Ill open up my soul
If thats what you need me to do
Now baby its your move
All you got to do is believe
In love
Just believe
In us




Just believe in love
Just believe in us

Texas In July,False Divinity,"I deny my eyes to the violence
To die inside with a price
Guilt weighing on my conscience
And no restraint for the fury that rises


Drive the nail through vacant enclosures
Forced to hide behind a fence for the damned
Feeding on toxicity its virulent
Consumed unconcerned a brand so permanent


Outreached hands meant for sustenance
Are bound by apathetic offenders
Your filthy fingernails ar gripped to a chalice
Forged from th spines of the overburdened


Set ablaze reanimate
Through suffering we will remain
Will remain


Shadowed by piercing eyes that graze across your back
So fade into a place that feeds your emptiness
All of your intentions are burdened by riches
False divinity feasting with the wretched

Wishing for better days
Your misguided eyes are blinded by the shine
Washed up and sent away
You felt more alive when you died on the inside


Set ablaze reanimate
Through suffering we will remain
This is all that it takes
Set ablaze when youre too close to the flame
Barely breathing
Set ablaze reanimate


Forged inside the flames
You placed the blame and hid your shame
Cover your face
Remember what you stood for
Became erased youve been betrayed and led astray
Embrace the end of your false divinity

I am the fear in your silence",metal

"Hank Williams, Jr.",Family Tradition,"Country music singers have always been a real close family
But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
I guess its because I kind of changed my direction
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition
They get on me they wanna know


Hank why do you drink Hank why do you roll smoke
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote
Over and over everybody made my prediction
So if I get stoned Im just carrying on an old family tradition


I am very proud of my daddys name
Although his kind of music and mine aint exactly the same
Stop and think it over put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family tradition
So dont ask me


Hank why do you drink Hank why do you roll smoke
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote
If Im down in a honkytonk and some ol slicks trying to give me friction
I say Leave me alone Im singing all night long its a family tradition

Lordy I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973
When that doctor asked me Son howd you get in this condition
I said Ahey Sawbones Im just carrying on an old family tradition
So dont ask me


Hank why do you drink Hank why do you roll smoke
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote
Stop and think it over try to put yourself in my unique position

Cant grow no crops in this concrete jungle

Battering down sentence oh live long day now

Could this be my destiny
With no one to care for the wellfare of my family
In solitude Ive found new faith and hope in this Ill be secure
For mind and soul would soon be weary
Just couldnt take no more

Wayne Shorter,Footprints - Remastered,"music  Wayne Shorter

Thousands of years before history recorded
Deep in the jungle a woman stepped on wet clay
And the print remained there
Future reminder of ages ago

Many lives later a traveler crossed the same path
Under the vines he saw traces of that footprint
Silent testimony
Spiritual journey begun long ago

Eons of changes illusion of some progress
Fearfulness leading us further from the soul power
Known in early ages
When natures heartbeat rang loud on the earth

The key to our freedom lies not just in our thinking
The ancient intuition thats buried deep within us
Is waiting to be set free
The creators gift to her children must flow

We call on the past now to show us where to go
Were closer to then than we may want to show
Were closer to then than we may really know

Ahmad Jamal,For All We Know,"Yo whats up this is Tre Hardson
Also known to you all as Slim Kid Tre
And the topic of today is uh
The influence of jazz

Now jazz has come a long way
Back in the days
There was bebop
And now its hip hop

Jazz was revolutionary
And hip hop is also revolutionary
Unlike rap
Raps not really getting the message across
Like our forefathers
Like the Gil ScottHerons you know
They paved the way
They set the pace
They set the tone
Like the Last Poets
All of these are great people great minds
To do things to carry the torch of our ancestors
To let us know whats really really going on around the world
Hip hop has definitely carried that torch in a positive way

Rap was a vehicle for stopping the violence
Just as jazz was back in the days
Back in the 60s back in the 30s
Quincy Jones McCoy Tyner Grant Green
Wes Montgomery Elvin Jones Miles Davis
Eric Gale Phil Sanders Freddie Hubbbard
Billy Higgins Jimmy Smith Wayne Shorter
Ahmad Jamal Thelonius Monk  all big influences
For what it is that we do
And what it is that we are
As we take our stance in music

Jazz was also like a secret conversation
I mean it was a universal language

So no matter what culture you came from
You would still hear the music
And feel the story even if you didnt know the words

In hip hop
We have to put our all into it
So you can feel the energy coming across just the same as the saxophone player
Who played with the same intensity and feeling

And thats what were all here for
To feel that love and vibration in music
To uplift the people indeed
To uplift the people indeed
So that is indeed an influence on me",jazz

Ricky Van Shelton,From A Jack To A King,"From a jack to a king
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen
And walked away with your heart

From a jack to a king
With no regrets I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
And made me king of your heart

For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a jack to a king
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen
You made me king of your heart

For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a jack to a king
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen
You made me king of your heart",Country

To death upon your bed of broken crowns
Once placed upon you
Find yourself
Or run and hide beneath your selfmade hell

But if Im gonna stay
Would you notice
Were falling out of place
Were so hopeless

We gave up We gave up
We gave up everything we had

Jamie's Elsewhere,Giants Among Common Men,"Its all the same nothings changed
Again I find myself in the current
As I am gracelessly tossed around and around
Your words echo and your voice resounds

When we awake from our sleep
Well know that this is where were supposed to be
With walls and walls and walls
Of water for miles

Just know this
We are so fragile
And easily broken
But Ill try my hardest
To put you back together
If you do the same for me

For now just sleep my sweet
Dont worry about what tomorrow brings
So lets pretend that were giants among common men
Because weve never been taller than our demons within

We are so fragile
And easily broken
But Ill try my hardest
To put you back together
If you do the same for me
We are so fragile
And easily broken
But Ill try my hardest

Know that I got your back
And when the weight is too heavy
Hope I can keep you on track yo

Giving no time to th doubters
The sour peopl watching the hours go by
While Im working on my craft Kraft
Like its mac and cheese

Like I didnt sacrifice all my life

The cold stress holding over my chest gotta ignore it
Hoping my voice shines through

An outlaw to the industry I fear no boss
Im independent while these rappers jaws locked
I dont talk with suspicion I be speaking from the heart
Cooking beats in the kitchen my catalogs  la carte five star
I used to think I wasnt blowing up quick enough
Until I realized who my listeners were
Real motherfuckers who love when I put in the work
All the times spent feeling like Im going berserk
Came from the dirt first and baby Im still here
I was rapping to the void now they open their ears
Gimme more time promise Ima do it for yall
Dont need a cosign no label just me and dawgs
And like a 45 one left in the chamber to pop

Praying that you get hurt
Do your worst cause its hard to brag

Billy Currington,Good Directions,"I was sitting there selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking This is where rednecks come from
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions and I was the man for the job


I told her Way up yonder past the caution light
Theres a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me


I was sitting there thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat and thought You fool it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldnt run her down
She probably didnt like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust


I told her Way up yonder past the caution light
Theres a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
See Billy Currington LiveGet tickets as low as 22
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me
Or am I really seeing what I think I see
The woman of my dreams coming back to me




She went way up yonder past the caution light

When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

Before you start your preachin let me ask you this my friend

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldnt worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten
They took all the footage off my TV
Said its too disturbin for you and me
Itll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me Id show it every day
Some say this countrys just out lookin for a fight
Well after 911 man Id have to say thats right

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten
Iv been there with the soldiers
Whove gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what theyre fighting for

Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Dont you tell me not to worry bout Bin Laden

She told him Youll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping shed come back again


He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single I love you
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didnt see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time Id seen him smile in years


He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon theyll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know she came to see him one last time
Oh and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin through my mind
This time hes over her for good


He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon theyll carry him away

We are the masses
We come from afar

For the freedom fighters mission
Brothers paid with their lives
For the rights that should have been free

Ive spent all night long trying to figure out
What Ive lost and what Ive found
When my feet wont hit the ground
Trying to make it starting over
And will we ever love again


Hey baby are you alone tonight
How can we make it
Hey baby looks like you were wrong
Its never too late too late


So here we are again to make some sense of it all
All these sudden changes
Maybe things are not so different
Rearranging pieces like its all we know
Its all we know letting go


Hey baby are you alone tonight
How can we make it
Hey baby looks like you were wrong
Its never too late too late

I keep putting together what weve lost
But pieces keep falling one by one
Cause this life has us holding on
For tomorrow then its gone
For tomorrow then Im gone


Hey baby it looks like you were wrong
How can we make it


Hey baby are you alone tonight
How can we make it
Hey baby looks like you were wrong
Its never too late too late


And well take it all Hey baby
Leave the rest behind
Theres no one else tonight tonight

She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin man
Down in New Orleans


Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time hes satisfied
Is when hes on a drug





Oh mothers tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
Im goin back to New Orleans

And you scandalise it in the street

Say its alright by me

And make sweet love to me

Lee Ann Womack,I Hope You Dance,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you emptyhanded


I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that youll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance


I hope you dance
I hope you dance


I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin might mean takin chances but theyre worth takin
Lovin might be a mistake but its worth makin


Dont let some hellbent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance Where those years have gone


I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that youll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance


Dance
I hope you dance

Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell

And did they get you to trade
Your heros for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage

Were just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found
The same old fears

Martina McBride,Independence Day,"Well she seemed alright by dawns early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasnt drinkin again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day


Well word gets around in a small small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin end
Some folks whispered some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
When time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day


Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away
Let the guilty pay
Its Independence Day

By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now I aint sayin its right or its wrong
But maybe its the only way
Talk about your revolution
Its Independence Day


Let freedom ring

Thought youd have noticed it by now
Its like Im falling out of view
A world of colour inside out
I said Ill show you how you


I dont wanna feel the way you feel
Well can you feel it too
Cause I dont wanna feel the way I feel
Dj vu into the dark with you


Into the dark with you
Into the dark with you


Louder than a supernova sound
All the vibrations still run through
They tear me apart from the inside out
She said Ill show you how you


Breathe me in just to feel something
Ill let you swim underneath my skin

I dont wanna feel the way you feel
Well can you feel it too
Cause I dont wanna feel the way I feel
Dj vu into the dark with you


I watched the tears fall down her cheeks
But couldnt watch an angel bleed
How do I lie straight through my teeth
And hold it in til I cant I cant breathe


Could you watch an angl bleed No
Could you watch an angel bleed


I dont wanna feel the way you feel

Common,Invocation,"Envisioning the hereafter listening to Steve Wonder
On a quest for love like the Proceed drummer
I strike like lightning and dont need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
Thats your lady I used to run up in her and chief weed from her
Its a cold world and niggas need summer
At times my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches outgrowing the streets
Theres a thin line between war and peace whores and Jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps scribbling freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye seeming contagious
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican hiphop is my garden
Dont give a fuck where you charting certain shit I cant honor
It aint that you selling its your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone you large and havent grown
Poetically perform livebys another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb I rap like a mummy
Not for the money I couldve sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key twenty
Young blood said he had dimes I prayed that he see twenty
Hollering at the brothers either you gon be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land
I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him
When it rained it fucked with him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming

And some crave for porterhouse steak

Even puddings harder than the work that you dont even put in

Puttin people in they place since I was hiding kush in cushions
I forgot her name so baby wouldnt lemme put my wood in
She just lubricate the tip and then she blow me like a woodwind
Who the fuck you think you is
I will jump you and your kids
Eat and people want a piece I keep my gun inside my fridge

Trap rapper ass backwards in a cold sweat
Cause my sound check be more rowdy than your whole set
I kill the game so my shawty smokin
Tried to rip apart my heart but thot its already broken
Posse growing so the bandwagon fillin up quickly
Reserve ya spot today cause pretty soon the partys closing
Token omnipotent
All the homies going holy smoke cause on the day that I was blown a God was chosen
Everybody follow me because I follow omens
Hide your bitches I got more game than Ronaldos coaches
Had to pave a way and make an individual
Staying plain and safe had made me go insane and miserable
Moving so silent that Im basically invisible
Brain so strong that Im breakin the invincible
Makin a militia who willing to bleed for me
Buzzing aint nobody round me that dont need the bee
I think you heard about a different party homie cause we headed to 5th Avenue youre on your way to Easy Street
People talk to me as if I was sane
As if Im normal tryna tell me I should buy me a chain listen
I dont glisten I got ice in my veins
Imma go down swingin and never get a strike to my name its human

Roberta Flack,Killing Me Softly With His Song,"Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song


I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
To listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes


Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song


I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song


He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasnt there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong


Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

Thats why Im alone

Until I questioned every answer unknown

Until my lungs collapsed on me

What piece am I left with

Carved out a place for my heart to rest
But it went numb instead
Its like a bullet to the brain
Scattered my thoughts across the walls
Painting the floor with every memory

Until my lungs collapsed on me

Watch as now youll see the crimson flood
Lets see you laugh with a mouth full of blood
Laugh as you die Ill laugh as you die
Your blood as it froths it stings in my eye
I thrust and I thrust but still youre not dead
I cant stop the madness that dwells in my head

With a knife in my hand my heart will be crossed
An evil heretic will find his life lost

Currents,Let Me Leave,"Wide awake in clothes I havent changed
For days and days as the sun creeps throughthewindow on myface
Just let it go
You say Imlike a ghost
My skin is white as paper as I haunt the halls of my home oh


I scream like it would stop the ache
Your colors start to show Show
I know what I have to do but it kills me


Rewriting all the songs
Id change your name but I know youll still take everything to heart
Just let it go
I wonder if well die with hope
Or if well be counting the sins we carry deeply as we go


I just wanted you to have a better life I just wanted you to have a better life
Not always shying away from your thoughts on the inside
I I could set you free
I put you on a shelf knowing that Id be
Too far to reach you from down in Hell
The sun slumps back as I burn your dreams
To the best of my ability so just let me leave

I scream like it would stop the ache
Your colors start to show Show
I know what I have to do but it kills me
Sleep if anything Ill dream
Its only then Ill have you
I know what I have to do but it kills me3",metal

Q-Tip,Let's Ride,"To all the lowriders the big riders
Word up
What happened in the car yo
Freal let a nigga


Brand new truck butter soft seats
Fourpointsomething with a low ridin something
Aint nothing better than to ride out the hood with it
Who looking better and damn you looking good in it
Take a chance with a nigga in the choice ride
Listen to the CDs I play inside
Mos Def Jay Prince and Stevie
Marvin Gaye Led Zeppelin and Biggie
And when the evening is over love
Gonna find a nice spot for the Rover love
Do things to make the man in the moon blush
My mind race but I tell my waist dont rush
Yous a upper echelon piece
So when you find theres a stash then you dont freak
You wanna nibble on a nigga ear
And do all the things that make a nigga wanna get near
Oh Im a Queens representative
Get wild by any means my incentive is
When we done I start it up again
And ride around with you cause you my special friend uh

Me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Dont worry just come get inside
Come on come on come on come on


The second part my ride is like art
We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
The backseat is the canvas we painting on
Abstract the word we creating on
The TVs in the back and the dash too
Got miss napkins and bamboo
Dont worry the tints passed the legal one
OutKast banging loud in my eardrum
The way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind
Outsiders looking in with the ill grin
Fuel injected brand new inspected
Emissions got tested details perfected
Got the Armor All touch empty out the Dutch
No tobacco spilling on my rug klutz
Kick off your shoes show off your pedicure
Shake off the blues we all for getting more
More of that thing
Stuff that brings ecstasy making you cling
A little harder than your average hug or grab
Lady tell me this is better than taking a cab
And when you bounce tell all your girls
You rode around hotwheeling drinking no earl
Vacationing V up my V8
Just one night we drive and we escape

Me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Dont worry just come get inside
Come on come on come on come on
Me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Dont worry just come get inside

Then we would never have to fight
So if we never used the brain

If man had never used his hands

Like winning money from the slot

Forget about stupidity
Discover your ability
Develop your creativity
Cultivate humility
To brave the stormy weather
Oh my brothers
And heed my foolish words


You see the more you give to life
Is the more youre gonna get from life
So go on and give
Dont count the cost
And the less you give to life
Is the less youre gonna get from life
So save your dough
And your soul might be lost
Verse 2
If every man should be the boss
Thered be no one to groom the horse
Mechanics none to fix the car
No humble man to spread the tar
If every man should be on top
Now tell me what the hell could stop
Top heavy from a fatal drop
Extinct would be the mortal crop

Its time we learned to be satisfied
Curtail resources running dry
Too much have you get rid of some
There are too many who have none
Oh my brother help them to face the stormy weather
And heed my foolish words once again


You see the more you give to life
Is the more youre gonna get from life
So go on and give
Dont count the cost
And the less you give to life
Is the less youre gonna get from life
So save your dough
And your soul might be lost lost

By a freeway I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death reading how well die alone
And if were good well lay to rest anywhere we wanna go


In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
Ill wait for you there like a stone
Ill wait for you there alone


And on my deathbed I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised the wine was bled and there you led me on


In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
Ill wait for you there like a stone
Ill wait for you there alone alone



And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things Ive done
For all that Ive blessed and all that Ive wronged
In dreams until my death I will wander on


In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
Ill wait for you there like a stone
Ill wait for you there alone alone75",rock

Cause these feelings cannot be real
I cant believe youve been taken from me without saying goodbye
One question taints my lips
Will time heal these wounds

I cant believe that the day has come
Knowing now I will never see your face again
If Id known so many years ago
I would have cherished every single second
But now I have to face the facts
That youre not coming back
And no matter how much this hurts
I will keep pushing forward

Please dont go
Cause I cant take this journey without you
Its like Im lost inside my own mind
Now youre gone whos left to guide me
Before the path below me subsides
These days turn to weeks in the palms of my hands
But Ill remember you the best that I can
Always the one that knew me the best
I cant bring you back but Ill never forget

Breathe oh God please breathe
I wont let him take you away from me
Just breathe you wont burn away into the sulphur
Nothing will ever tarnish your legacy
I will follow into your footsteps until it kills me
I havent slept for days
Im sick of sinking through the cracks you left when you went away
But I must carry on be strong for those I love
I swear Ill never forget you

You will always be more than just a memory

We fail to keep sight over and over again

Crimson feet trample our joints
We splinter and break
We suffer again
We become a path others use to take
A distant undertaking suffer the same
Ill stand right beside you
We slog side by side


Become a path others use to take
Lost in the static
Just to suffer the same


Come dig me up wipe the earth from my bones
Hold me up and join me on the horizon
Kill whats left of the inner glow
Giving up the ghost
Growing cold
We never begin We never begin
Our own feet trample our joints
We burn both ends
A blur on the horizon
We become a path others use to take
A distant undertaking suffer the same
Ill stand right beside you
We slog side by side

Joey Bada$$,Love Is Only a Feeling,"Look I love her curves but whats more preferred
Is the way she articulates words
Cant help observe and stare when she in the mirror
Masking the massacre while she fixing her hair
I mean shes so perfect in her own little world
We built the foundation everything I want in a girl
And its a matter of time until her last name mine
You got potential baby just imagine us combined
I wanna see you shine like the gem that you are
Want you be so secure that they can see from afar
That you dont need not a man and you can stand on your own
Lets keep stacking your bread and one day we gon get gone
And get away from here
Youre the only reason I be staying here
Wanna paint a picture lets make it clear
The future so bright baby race you there girl


Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling


Look girl you talk too much need to relax
No stress please just please roll us a fat
Blunt so we can smoke and fill the room with love
You buzz cause Im feelin the groove with this one
Come take you a sip lets dance under the moon
The way that its lit got me feelin the mood
To vibe and be tuned Im so into you
Lets lose track of the night and stay up til its noon
Watch the sun rise and watch the moon fall
Asleep if you will surprise when you spawn
Back from the world of infinite beyond
Roll your eyes back and lets keep on goin
Come take a ride Ill be your chauffeur
I wanna make you sing to me as your toes curl
I love it when she doing all the things I showed her
I thank the Lord for her man I swear I owe her

Bleeding Through,Love Lost In A Hail Of Gun Fire,"This was a fucking bomb
For a few seconds this place was Armageddon
There was a firefight

You are the fucking disease
Another day another memory
But I have fucking failed
I turned another lie into the work of a saint

So where is the cure Hundreds of souls
With the look of horror on their face

Now I rise from my knees
I will not live in misery

You wont take me
You wont take me
Now its me
Now its me

All thats left is a bitter taste
Of a life that was once so promising
Rather cut at the wrist
Than laugh about your mistakes
Sickness still fills the air
Another life that you wish you could fake
Your eyes will cut through me but its a risk
That I must fucking take
I must take
So where is the cure Hundreds of souls
With the look of horror on their face

Now I rise from my knees
I will not live in misery

You wont take me
You will not destroy me
You cannot destroy me
And Ill fight you with every ounce of strength I have left
And Ill seal it with a bullet and a kiss
So look at your fucking horror

Horror
I wanna see your face
Show me your true face
I wanna see your face
Show me your true face

And my heart belongs to you so save me
And my heart belongs to you so save me
For the sake to give it away
Still beats still beats still beats still beats
Still beats inside of me

And my heart belongs to you so save me
And my heart still beats
And my heart still beats
My heart still beats so save me
My heart still beats",metal

Collin Raye,"Love, Me","I read a note my grandma wrote
Back in 1923
Grandpa kept it in his coat
And he showed it once to me
He said Boy you might not understand
But a long long time ago
Grandmas daddy didnt like me none
But I loved your Grandma so


We had this crazy plan to meet
And run away together
Get married in the first town
We came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree
Where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter
And this is what it said


If you get there before I do
Dont give up on me
Ill meet you when my chores are through
I dont know how long Ill be
But Im not gonna let you down
Darling wait and see
And between now and then till I see you again
Ill be loving you Love me

I read those words just hours before
My grandma passed away
In the doorway of a church
Where me and Grandpa stopped to pray
I know Id never seen him cry
In all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her
His eyes filled up with tears


If you get there before I do
Dont give up on me
Ill meet you when my chores are through
I dont know how long Ill be
But Im not gonna let you down
Darling wait and see
And between now and then till I see you again

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mamas phone started ringin off the hook
I can hear her now sayin she aint gonna have it
Dont matter how you feel it only matters how you look


Go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this aint my mamas broken heart


I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and theres nobody else to blame

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,Mary Jane's Last Dance,"She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
Well she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away was more than theyd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin
She said I dig you baby but I got to keep movin on
Keep movin on


Last dance with Mary Jane one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin in and Im tired of this town again


Well I dont know but Ive been told
You never slow down you never grow old
Im tired of screwin up tired of going down
Tired of myself tired of this town


Oh my my oh hell yes
Honey put on that party dress
Buy me a drink sing me a song
Take me as I come cause I cant stay long

Last dance with Mary Jane one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin in and Im tired of this town again


Theres pigeons down on Market Square
Shes standin in her underwear
Lookin down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin soon


Oh my my oh hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road


Last dance with Mary Jane one more time to kill the pain

Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

Through all kinds of weather through everything we done
Yeah Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas Lord I let him slip away
Hes lookin for that home and I hope he finds it
But Id trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin Bobbys body next to mine

Twist all the shapes inside my mind

That it all ends tonight

Holding us down forcing pain onto your dead eyes
You know theyre pulling me
Back into the needles eye

And take your sleep
Its not the kind you need but something equally binding
Do we really know where our bodies lie
When we fall back asleep
Just sit back and fall into dreams

The end of suffering
Just take your pill to pass the time
Look in the past
Stare in the blank face
Hallucinogens make you feel alive

Ooh
Where do we go
Sleep away all your life

Unearth,My Will Be Done,"So many have lost their way
So many have fallen to their grip of faith
Controlled by their words of hate
Divided we ravage our homelands

The abundance of of numbness can claim self rule
Diseased transmission can claim us all

A system of panic enslaves
The binding obtainment brings darker days
A stand must be taken to save
No cries for us the war is waged
Its done

I strive to find my way
My will be done
Work these hands until they bleed
My will be done
Ill listen for the call
My will be done
Now pray for your miracle
My will be done

No cries for us the war is waged
My will be done
The abundance of numbness can claim self rule
Diseased transmission can claim us all



So many have lost their way
So many have fallen to their grip of faith
Controlled by their words of hate
Divided we perish

Now I strive to find my own way

Work these hands until they bleed

"Myka, Relocate",Nerve,"Youve got a lot of nerve youre a disaster
You know you dont deserve

Ive failed to see all the red flags you put in front of me
In too deep Couldnt see I was in your way

Trapped in the dark cant find the light
When youre taught to look down your whole life

Youve got a lot of nerve youre a disaster
You know you dont deserve what your after
So sick of watching you abuse almost anyone whos feeling sorry for you

When your luck runs out youll crawl on your hands  knees
Desperate  lonely youll say anything to me

But youll never admit your lack of regret
Wont pull me under Ill never forget this time
Youre too fucked up to learn
Go find another bridge to burn

Trapped in the dark cant find the light
When youre taught to look down your whole life
Youve got to face what you cant escape before it bleeds us dry

Youve got a lot of nerve youre a disaster
You know you dont deserve what your after
So sick of watching you abuse almost anyone whos feeling sorry for you
You walk through this world with your hands tied
You havent known yourself for a long time

This is where we are
Drop the bottle Ill take the fall before you lose it all
Before theres nothing left before theres nothing left before theres nothing

Youve got a lot of nerve youre a disaster
You know you dont deserve what your after
So sick of watching you abuse almost anyone whos feeling sorry for you",metal

Face split in two lived the life of a coward
I started giving up on myself
Stared into darkness with faces I wish Id forget

Fever putting me to sleep
I owe myself for this
Lungs collapse and bones starts to break
Stuck in the darkness with the snakes

I was nowhere for the longest time
And no one could save me from myself
I was nowhere for the longest time
And no one could sav me from myself

I buried myslf ten feet below

I was trapped in my own misguided world
Its fucking hard to stay away
Its fucking hard to live without you
But I will never go back there again

I was never alive
Traded my soul for misery

Stayed with the snakes to cover myself from reality
I started shedding skin
I am trapped in my own misguided world
I stayed with the snakes for the longest time
Its fucking hard to stay away
Its fucking hard to live without you
But I will never go back there again

I fucking loathe myself
I fucking loathe myself

Stepped out from the darkness I contained in me
Released myself from the shackles I helped create

Ive got the power of life in my hands
And I intend to keep it
My life has meaning after all1",metal

And that was me
You saw me at my worst
You saw the worst in me
Tell me that Im wrong
Tell me that Im wrong
I cant forgive you but I cant look away
I walked through fire I was born in the flames

Keep telling myself that I was the victim
You were the one that pulled away
Ive got a cold heart
This is the sad part
I dont think I can change
Can one of us be saved
I feel like Im better
Feels like Im better
Better in a grave


Can one of us be saved

Sugar diabetes and blubber on my hips

So I can go downstairs and cruise
I got them oreo creme sandwich

I hideem in a cabinet I keepem in a jar
For emergencys you know I keepem in the
Glove compartment of my car

Loyle Carner,Ottolenghi,"I was sat up on the train
Staring out the window at the rain aye
I heard this little lady mustve felt the pain
Ask her mum if the blazing sunll ever shine again
I felt ashamed feel the same not her Mother though
Nah started to laugh got her son involved aye
Mention the past like a running joke
And told her without all the rain theres no stunning growth
Close ah To everything and nothing
Picture past the honeymoon and bluffing
Where the wooden spoon is only cuffing
Shorter the discussion
But the roots cant manoeuvre out of nothing
Ive been suffering these dreamy days ah
Remedy and lust dont hold any memories of us
Rather hold you everyday until the memories are dust
Yo we only caught the train cause you know I hate the bus
Never get enough

Aye They ask about the bible I was reading
Told them that the title was misleading
Labelled it Jerusalem but really its for cooking MiddleEastern
I could see your mind was changing
With the seasons shady for a reason ah
They will start decreasing
Leaving like the orange in the evening
It was creeping through the clouds
But now Im proud to see the images releasing
I just wish the little lady couldve seen it but she was dreaming
Ah Reckon shes standing with her mum saying to her
Look Mother heres the sun
Rooted in the moment til the memories are done
So I sit and start to wonder on the woman shell become
Wonder if Ill have a son or a daughter ones that I brought up Never strong never telling me to run
Never tried to find a sum
Tryna get it done
Yo I wonder if shell ever be as clever as her mum one


Born and raised

Life can be bad it can turn bad in a second
So remember what Im tryna show you

And Im gonna look for that for my time

The Rolling Stones,"Paint It, Black","I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes


I see a line of cars and theyre all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby it just happens every day


I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door I must have it painted black
Maybe then Ill fade away and not have to face the facts
Its not easy facing up when your whole world is black


No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

Heart Of A Coward,Passenger,"Youve got to swallow the lie if you want to believe
Darkness hides in all that you see
Burrowed inside your mind
You know youll never be free
And in time this will tear you apart
The darkness devours your heart
Lost in this vacant state
Emotionless you circle the drain

Just a mindless passenger
Sleepwalking through existence This is the end

Your eyes are open you cant see
You blindly follow off the edge
Your eyes are open you cant see
Just a mindlss passenger

Youre trappd inside the perpetual lie
Never be able to see with your eyes
Just another mindless drone walking the path of least resistance
Hollow existence I see right through
You never escape from the grip around your throat

Sleepwalking through existence This is the end

Your eyes are open you cant see
You blindly follow off the edge
Your eyes are open you cant see

Joe Diffie,Pickup Man,"Well I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
Theres something women like about a pickup man


When I turned sixteen I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruisin the town and the first girl I see
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry the homecomin queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said I never knew you were a pickup man


You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man


Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drivein show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
Cause theres something women like about a pickup man

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man


A bucket of rust or a brandnew machine
Once around the block and youll know what I mean


You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldnt trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eightfoot bed that never has to be made
You know if it werent for trucks we wouldnt have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
Theres just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah theres something women like about a pickup man

With heart full of fire and third eye
Steady my vision my climb
I I knew with all my mind

The dream manifesto to get it and dont let go
Praises to the most high eyes are kinda set low
A man of many faces
I rock the crooked smile since they took off my braces
Back on Stony Isle we was on our own oasis
Mild sauce hot tempers cold cases huh
I ran the town not knowing it was races
Standing on the deck smokin aces
Grace is the wonderland
I see the face of the Son of Man
A fatherless child that made it to the motherland
I think how far these raps really took me
A veteran in the game I stay fresh like a rookie
When I was underground they used to overlook me
Now flicks and book tours make it hard for them to book me
The presence of Ra the essence of a star
Jewelry and a car suggesting who we are
The blessings of Jah that come through us all
Im seasoned yall I never knew when to fall
In the quicksand



The pictures been clear since this mans been a shorty
Consolidate the dollars go dumb E40
No pimping in your poetry
No sleeping with your jewelry off
And when you get your chance slam dunk it Ronny Turiaf
And I did that me and my guys repping the city
And I hustle with no pity they christen me Frank Nitty
And I took that and I ran with it made a few stacks and some bands with it
But then I brought it home a student must then teach his own
And I could never dream it could go from the Yanceys basement
To be standing up on stages in front of some foreign faces
Get love in those foreign places like we from there and oh yea
They like Where the dollars at
Im like Imma call you back
And please let me clarify
Playa Ill be damned if I
Ever let the picture fade to black before I say goodbye
Spot you like you Spotify
Nitty make the song cry
Imma let Illa sing his lullaby
Quicksand



I heard a hater say I never be more than J Dillas little brother
I never be more than an insignificant other
I never be more than a video standin
But here I am still standing
When you haters try to leave me in the quicksand
Left me outside the club with no wristband
Now Im pissed off like Im repping the Pistons
And I came all the way from fuckin Michigan
Thats when the shit hit the fan then I moved back
Had to do my Stella still I had to get my groove back
Then I came up with a plan to put my shoes back on
I ran hella hella fast until I proved that
I could do it while Im swimming in the pool of sweat blood and tears
My career I had to keep pursuing that
And I could do that with my eyes closed
Cause I know Im fly always knew I

Said wed take on the world for a ride
Weve done it all backwards
Just stayed in line
Weve learnt that you and I have two sides
It comes and goes and leaves no signs
Ill pray to God if you end up fine


You can always hate you can always feel me
You can tell the world Im a lie but Im finding
Back to myself back to myself


Its cold but I will swear to hold you tight
Just run away with me just run away with me
Ill drive if you will swear to be my light
Just run away with me just run away with me


A week ago when I was lost
I found my head in the same old spot
I cant control myself
I cant control myself
How can I find whatever was lost
How can you try when you feel so numb
Or nothing at all
Or nothing at all

You can always hate you can always feel me
You can tell the world Im a lie but Im finding
Back to myself back to myself


Its cold but I will swear to hold you tight
Just run away with me just run away with me
Ill drive if you will swear to be my light
Just run away with me just run away with me


Weve gone through hell and weve been through it
Weve seen it all before never want to see it again
I dont want to be dont want to be nobody else
I just want to find just want to find myself


Its cold but I will swear to hold you tight
Just run away with me just run away with me
Ill drive if you will swear to be my light

Im telling yall its sabotage


So so so so listen up cause you cant say nothing
Youll shut me down with a push of your button
But yo Im out and Im gone
Ill tell you now I keep it on and on


Cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so dont you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing thats a mirage
Im trying to tell you now its sabotage

Our backs are now against the wall

Listen all yall its a sabotage

I should breathe in

Its all right they dont know what you go through
Feel you hesitate made from my mistakes
Only can blame myself


But is it suicide or sabotage you think
Cause I feel you slipping


Far from me fading slowly
Every time I hurt myself I push away your help
And you know my soul is empty
Is it suicide or sabotage you think
I see it in my blood its dripping in the sink
Is it suicide or sabotage you think
Cause I feel you slipping


Another night spent alone been a month since you felt something
Oh you never thought that you would be like this
You medicate every day that she spends with him
But sit tight youll fix it when youre supposed to
Its alright they dont know what you go through
Poison every day coursing through your veins
Only can blame myself

And now youre just so far from me fading slowly
Every time I hurt myself I push away your help
And you know my soul is empty
Is it suicide or sabotage you think
I see it in my blood its dripping in the sink
Is it suicide or sabotage you think
Cause I feel you slipping


Oh I feel it in my veins and I hear it in my dreams
But is it suicide or sabotage you think
I see it in my blood its dripping in the sink
Is it suicide or sabotage cause my bodys breaking down
And now you feel so


Far from me fading slowly
Every time I hurt myself I push away your help

Son Seals,Sadie,"Dooley Jones was doomed since the day that he was born
All because his mama was Sadie Jones
Cruel words upon him ever since he was young

Children heard the facts at home
Talked them up in school
Teased him til his mind was bent and bruised
you aint got no daddy Dooley Jones

Weight upon his shoulder
A thorn stuck in his soul
His body walks and talks
But his mind has no control

Youre no mans son youre no mans child

Every day for miles
Babbling to birds flying by
Babbling to the birds as they fly by

Somewhere some man hides his eyes
Cause Dooley is his child

Well I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of  Crown
And everybodys getting down
An this town aint never gonna be the same


Cause I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse Ride a cowboy

Well I dont give a dang about nothing
Im singing and BlingBlinging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down
And I wouldnt trade ol Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
Im the only John Wayne left in this town

Im a thouroughbred
Thats what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We where flying high
Fine as wine having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going just about as far as shed let me go

But her evaluation
Of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
All night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love
And I saddled up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse ride a cowboy

I Killed The Prom Queen,Say Goodbye,"Storm clouds hanging overhead
Offer not the slightest bit of comfort for the first time in days
I wait to discover disasters that Ive slept though while I felt so alive
So we say goodbye so we say goodbye

Heartstrings severed just as quick as they were discovered
So we say goodbye so we say goodbye
Ill break my own fall to keep you picture perfect
Just dont wake me up now

So say goodbye close your eyes for the last time
Questioning everything that went wrong

The silence  she whispers to me
Telling me things we dare to speak out loud
The collaboration of the blinding sun
Through vacant streets hits home hard
Like a hatchet to the skull

Id keep you here if it kept me warm and these winters away
Your hands were the only hands needed to hold me
For the first time in days I feel alive
In the end well both rot together
In the end well rot together our love lies in embers

So say goodbye close your eyes for the last time
Questioning everything that went wrong
Peering out of those same cracked windows
That I studied for days upon days
Suddenly collapse it all falls down
So say goodbye close your eyes for the last time
Questioning everything that went wrong",metal

Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed she knows no limits
She craves attention she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh she dont see the light thats shinin
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
Cause covergirls dont cry
After their face is made
But


Theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
You should know youre beautiful just the way you are
And you dont have to change a thing the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful


Ohohoh
Ohohohoh
And you dont have to change a thing the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy so shes
Starving you know covergirls eat nothin
She says Beauty is pain and theres beauty in everything whats a little bit of hunger
I can go a little while longer she fades away
She dont see her perfect she dont understand shes worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface oh oh
So to all the girls thats hurtin let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within


Theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
You should know youre beautiful just the way you are
And you dont have to change a thing the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful


Ohohoh
Ohohohoh
And you dont have to change a thing the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful


No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life were livin
No better life than the life were livin
No better time for your shine youre a star
No better time for your shine youre a star
Oh youre beautiful oh youre beautiful

Theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
You should know youre beautiful just the way you are
And you dont have to change a thing the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful

So this time Ill make you proud proud of who you raised up
You know that I will always be here til the end
Come back so I can say thank you for this
Home cooked meals and a place to rest


My troubled head when youre away
Ive passed the test Ive earned an A
Not just in school but in life
Youll always be right by my side
To help me show hope to all
That are lost and sick in this dying world
Ill use the love you left behind
Ill change their minds Ill change their minds

I hope I hope you smile when you look down on me
I hope you smile
This cant we wont know

She had a hard time
Dont misunderstand her
Or play with her mind

Treat her so gently
It will pay you in time

Shes a sensitive kind

Tell her you love her
Each and every night
You will discover
She will treat you right

If you believe
I know you will find
There aint nothing like
A sensitive kind

She gets so lonely
Waiting for you
You are the only
Thing to help her through

Dont take her for granted

Watched it pour as I touched your face

Miss May I,Shadows Inside,"Revived recreated
Every single burn I still feel it
Contaminated but I dont need the cure
No blood no redemption
Every single lie I still hear them
Reaching for the sun I wont be ignored


Ive been set ablaze
Now I can finally breathe


Caught in the flames theres nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
Embrace the change and then you will find
New light will break the shadows inside
The shadows inside


Blinded devastated
Everything I was imitated
You used to know me but now you dont anymore
My world my reflection
Everything I am separated
All I desired was the spark to restore

Ive been set ablaze set ablaze
And I dont want to change


Caught in the flames theres nowhere to hide
New light will break the shadows inside
Embrace the change and then you will find
New light will break the shadows inside

The ashes fade and I remain

People stop and everybody stares
She dont know what theyre starin for


She dont know shes beautiful Never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful No shes not that kind

And someone lets a whistle out
A girl like her she just cant see
What the fuss is all about


And she dont know shes beautiful Never crossed her mind
She dont know shes beautiful No shes not that kind

Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away
Settling down would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please
Shed have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot his heart wasnt in it
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up
At Kittys place


I shouldve been a cowboy
I shouldve learned to rope and ride
Wearing my sixshooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing a young girls heart
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh I shouldve been a cowboy


I mightve had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west young man havent you been told
Californias full of whiskey women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart

I shouldve been a cowboy
I shouldve learned to rope and ride
Wearing my sixshooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing a young girls heart
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh I shouldve been a cowboy

If you gonna accuse me of pourin too much salt in the wound
We have just proved that they can pollute our heads with the news

And all of us forget it cause our heads inside the noose
They will manipulate the masses again

You can change but you cant deny

You have come so far youve got so far to go yeah
You have come so far youve got so far to go yeah


Let go and let me live inside you
What your mouth dont say baby your thighs do
I want us to arrive together
I love it when the weather
Is wet and sticky some depict me
As being conscious yeah I use my head
It was you that fed my appetite for seduction
Biting and cussing making love and uh
Touching where no one has ever touched before
The heat got you open like an oven door
Because of your innocence
Even more youll remember this hardcore gentleness
Before you wasnt into this
On the ride your freak became limitless
Holding on to the night and me tight
As we write on the walls a story called Go

You have come so far youve got so far to go
You have come so far youve got so far to go


I love it when we do it
You do it like you believe it
Able to give and receive it with openness
Emotions just spill
Im giving you something that you can feel
Its hard to stay still
Rubbing your desires up against mine
I feel you shakin Im thinkin that next time
My fingers on the hook of your neck
Deep in your eyes is a look of respect
Soft wet brown sugar mixed with cinnamon
Said you learning to trust men again
If this is love made our self
Is made for you to feel empowered at the same time helpless
You dealt with a lot and your screams and moans
Something bout you go off that I see Im home
For we dont have to think no more
Its synchronicity and raw
And this is what I came here for


You have come so far youve got so far to go
You have come so far youve got so far to go17",hiphop

I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh a sailors sky made a perfect sunset
And thats the day Ill never forget


I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart dont forget something like that


Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked I couldnt believe just what I saw
She said I bet you dont remember me
And I said only every other memory

Ben Webster,Stardust,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that were apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

And engage in our own celebration

Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music I hear so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud


Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue

If you arrive and dont see me

One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a wellbeaten path
Its funny how those memories they last


Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine


I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste

Her mamas heart was broke
And that was all she wrote
Or so the story goes


Now her daddys in the kitchen
Starin out the window
Scratchin and arackin his brains
How could eighteen years just up and walk away
Our little ponytailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now shes gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin out on the line


Now dont you wonder
What the preachers gonna preach about Sunday mornin
Nothing quite like this
Has happened here before
Well he must have been a looker
A smooth talkin son of a gun
For such a grounded girl
To just up and run
Course you cant fence time
And you cant stop love

Shes got her pretty little bare feet
Hangin out the window
And theyre heading up to Vegas tonight


How could eighteen years just up and walk away
Our little ponytailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now shes gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin out on the line
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin out on the line

She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Plenty old enough
And you cant stop love
No you cant fence time
And you cant stop love Ooh",Country

Where as a child Id hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Charlie Daniels,Talk To Me Fiddle,"If this old fiddle could talk
If this old fiddle could sing
Man if this old fiddle could only talk it could tell
You some wondrous things talk to me fiddle
Tell me about when you came across the sea
In the hands of a Jewish immigrant who was
Longing to be free you were part of his life
For forty years through times both lean and fat
And he raised his family and lived out his days
In a New York tenement flat talk to me fiddle
Talk to me fiddle tell me about how that Cajun
Fiddling man found you in a pawn shop and took
You back down to the Louisiana bayou land
You knew his wife and you knew his kids
And you watched his family grow and you
Played your heart out Cajun style
At the Louisiana Fais Do Do
Then a big shot Yankee gambler found you
Down in New Orleans and took you up the
River on the Mississippi Queen then there
Came the day that you were all that he had left to lose
And a black man won you in a poker game
And taught you how to play the blues cry for me fiddle
Then a young man from the mountains of Kentucky came along
And he bought you for a dollar took you all away back home
He gave you to his grandpa on his golden wedding day
And people had come from miles around
Just to hear the old man play
Dance for them fiddle
Then a hobo from Biloxi found you living in the rain
And he got himself a free ride on a westbound cattle train
You got off in Texas where they play that western swing
Where the people do the twostep and old Bob Wills was the king
Swing for me fiddle
If this old fiddle could talk if this old fiddle could sing
Man if this old fiddle could only talk it could tell

Some days youre the best thing in my life
Sometimes when I look at you I see my wife
Then you turn into somebody I dont know
And you push me away push me away yeah

Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way youre looking through my eyes
Dont know if Im gonna make it out alive

And never never never ever let go
Fight so dirty but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth

Blood on my shirt heart in my hand
Still beating

But its always raining here inside

You really had a hold on me
Its a mean old love
With a flame that never dies


Wont you tell me why

Everywhere I go youre in my shadow
When I turn around theres no one there
And its a real bad sign
Im walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared


Wont you tell me why

And theyll say love fades away

Was tequila makes her clothes fall off


I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patrn
Her closets missing half the things she bought
Yeah tequila makes her clothes fall off


Shell start by kickin out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink


Them pantyhose aint gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on

But she never called me up
Had to know what was going on
So I drove by her house and sure enough

That aint my shadow on her wall
Lord this dont look good at all
Thats my girl my whole world
But that aint my truck

I pulled over by the curb
Ive been sitting here all night
Wondering what it was I did so wrong that he did so right
I thought of breaking down the door
But theres nothing left to say
That Chevy 4x4 says it all
Sitting in my place

Man this aint my day tonight

The Charlie Daniels Band,The Devil Went Down to Georgia,"The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind
And he was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin on a fiddle and playin it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said Boy let me tell you what


I guess you didnt know it but I am a fiddle player too
And if youd care to take a dare Ill make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle boy but give the Devil his due
Ill bet a fiddle o gold against your soul cause I think Im better than you
The boy said My names Johnny and it might be a sin
But Ill take your bet and youre gonna regret cause Im the best theres ever been


Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause Hells broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul


The Devil opened up his case and he said Ill start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this



When the Devil finished Johnny said
Well youre pretty good ol son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how its done


Fire on the Mountain run boys run
The Devils in the house of the risin sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin out dough
Granny does your dog bite No child no




The Devil bowed his head because he knew that hed been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnnys feet
Johnny said Devil just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch Im the best theres ever been


He played Fire on the Mountain run boys run

Devastate cant relate
Stay the fuck away from me
Werunat nothing tillwe cant turn back
So we digour way to the other side
I finally feel like I can breathe again
Take a moment to absorb the consequence of taking the fall
I shed my skin once and for all


The light is shifting out of sight but not out of mind


What the light has failed to capture
Is this the end of all we know
I will not deny the warning signs
This time I will not stand alone


Fall into insanity again and again
Lingering obsessions
Dwell in the shadows below
In this moment there is pain in our eyes
All that we have left we will die for
I finally feel like I can breathe again
Take a moment to absorb the consequence of taking the fall

What the light has failed to capture
Is this the end of all we know
I will not deny the warning signs
This time I will not stand alone


Ive spent years on the ground looking up at the world for mercy
I shed my skin
Let the fires rise
From the ashes we will see the light
Where the embers lie
Our liberty no longer denied


What the light has failed to capture
Is this the end of all we know
I will not deny the warning signs
This time I will not stand alone3",metal

Im ready

You know the chronicles the shit that if mama knew
The stress the drama do the TECs phemonenal
Rapid fire it pecks through the abdominal
You bastard liars its me whos the honorable
Bathed and clothed up shaved and closecut
Restraint from temptation was drained from both nuts
Heh now in the physical form
Verbalize through the scriptures I was Biblically born
Its Iah Jeremiah conceived through the blunt fire
On Kawasakis can wheelie up on one tire
Well respected jail connected
Got the method for them pretty females perfected
For sure very few flaws heavy Chevy twodoors
Candy paint itll give a nigga the blue balls
Pause this the life I chose
Done did the 360 the cyphers closed
Cmon


The format is real sickenin contagious
Here I come AZ there you go
Still I dont have to run no game I done those things

Young and gifted my tongues prolific
In the beach bungalow is how I brung in Christmas
For the streets Ima flow from the hungriest districts
Swiss kicks crisp when I come to them picnics
Play slow paper chase stack and lay low
Range Rove tinted all black the same old
Psychic mind righteous rhymes
Done turned a new leaf from my life of crime
No concerns with new beef whos as nice as Im
Its confirmed from few feet Im still a sniper blind
Built my fame spilt my pain
Politickin daily still tryin to milk the game
Its obvious that Im real rap skills remain
I took some change and Im still the same


The format is real sickenin contagious
Here I come AZ there you go
Still I dont have to run no game I done those things


Learnt the system burned some izm
Jotted my jewels down like journalism
How I maneuve now itll merge the wisdom
A pilgrim prophesize puttin words to rhythm
Relatin I Adam Clayton it manifestation patient
Meditatin with them animals waitin
Pacin like an inmate that sealed his fate
Let some years escape but Im still in shape
Im chillin deeply rooted a beast with music
From BedStuy to the East Im too at peace to lose it
But love it I still does it breathin off a Trump budget
Fresh out of Bloomies with the Louis luggage

E fica mais lindo por causa do amor

When she walks shes like a samba that
Swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes each one she passes goes ah

Oh but he watches her sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he

Really dont impress me in bed

Polaris,The Remedy,"Heavy hangs the air
Heavy lies the beating heart


Bloodshot staring with a blank gaze
Deadbeat carrying a dead weight
Deadset on living like tomorrow was to blame
And through these holes youd see the blackest soul inside of me
One foot stuck in the past one planted in my grave


Running circles old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless call me stuck in my ways
Im torn between the remedies for everything


Bloodshot staring with a blank gaze
Deadbeat carrying a dead weight
Dry mouth taste it like a cut vein
Blackout it all ends the same


So stay away stay away
Can you tell when I lie right through my teeth
No escape no escape
Like a chain in a way we are all bound to our fate

Dont let it bury me me
We call this therapy


Running circles old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless call me stuck in my ways
Im torn between the remedies for everything


Heavy hangs the air
Heavy lies the beating heart
Burden breeds remorse
Black clouds hover low like a curse
Like a curse


Running circles old habits die hard running circles
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless call me stuck in my ways call me reckless
Im torn between the remedies for everything the remedies for everything

Whitechapel,The Saw Is the Law,"This is our way of life
And we sleep away
Our misery in our bloodsoaked sheets


Weve left our homes to infect the world
And addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars infinite blood to bleed
Our presence stops your heart and leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees
And recognize your newfound kings


Where we come from the saw is the law
When theres no hope left we will not fall
Among the giants we still stand tall
And we will not be stopped


Just let it go and let the wind blow
Its like a hurricane inside of your head
The pressures never ending but your brain is still depending
And comprehending why it is still defending just let go
And be one with the family
Your life decisions have become our control
And we will swallow

Let me feel your hesitation
Nothing ventured nothing gained

All your reflections as an open secret
All your mistakes as a success
Your tears as the pitiful disport
Your decisions make us win
Follow the guide we gave you


Dont look upward theres nothing above you
Your eyes arent qualified
Your memory is your future
Can you remember your end


We we are your faith and your fear
We are your inspiration and your overload

Youre all equal

This is your reality your veiled sight

You can never see
You can put the blame on us
You can put the blame on us

Its all about your personal interpretation of what youre looking at


I see you try to grow with your scars
But you fail again and again
You can put the blame on us
This is what this is what we expect


This makes your life so much easier
Just close your eyes follow blindly
In your deepest dreams you can see us
In your lonely hours you can feel us
In your lonely hours you can feel us
You can feel us you can feel us


This prison was built for you
You are not ready for the outside
Maybe you will never be
Maybe you will never see

So why why dont you change within
Positions wont change

Chris LeDoux,This Cowboy's Hat,"Well I was sittin in a coffee shop just havin a cup to pass the time
Swappin rodeo stories with this old cowboy friend of mine
When some motorcycle riders started snickerin in the back
Started pokin fun at my friends hat
One old boy said Hey Tex whered you park your horse
My friend just pulled his hat down low but they couldnt be ignored
One husky fella said I think Ill just rip that hat right off your head
Thats when my friend turned around and this is what he said


Youll ride a black tornado cross the western sky
Youll rope an old Blue Norther and milk it till its dry
Bulldog the Mississippi pin its ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat


He said Partner now this ole hats better left alone
See it used to be my daddys but last year he passed on
My nephew skinned the rattler that makes up this here old hatband
But back in 69 he died in Vietnam
Now the eagle feather was given to me by an Indian friend of mine
But somebody ran him down somewhere around that Arizona line
And a real special lady gave me this here hat pin
But I dont know if Ill ever see her again

Youll ride a black tornado cross the western sky
Youll rope an old Blue Norther and milk it till its dry
Bulldog the Mississippi pin its ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat


Now if your leather jacket means to you what this hat means to me
Then I guess we understand each other and well just let it be
But if you still think its funny man you got my back up against the wall
And if you touch my hat youre gonna have to fight us all
Right then I caught a little sadness in that gang leaders eyes
And he turned back towards the others and they all just kinda shuffled on outside
But when my friend turned back towards me I noticed his old hat brim
Well it look like it was turned up in a big old Texas grin


Youll ride a black tornado cross the western sky
Youll rope an old Blue Norther and milk it till its dry
Bulldog the Mississippi pin its ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat",Country

I suppose I was just made that way
Loneliness and gloom fills my lonely little room
Perhaps soon youll chase my emptiness away

Till youve reached my gate

I try to fake a smile but nothing hides my sadness
Pretending that Im fine Im only lying all the time
I crossed the line from melancholy into madness

Till then Ill wait
Till youve reached my gate
Lying every night
Till you blessed my sight

I never knew what just one dance can do
Now Im through with all my searching love I found you
Darling dont you fret I swear this love you wont regret
I will protect and put my loving arms around you

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift


The world is the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide
Todays Tom Sawyer he gets high on you
And the space he invades he gets by on you



No his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful yet discontent
He knows changes arent permanent
But change is


And what you say about his company

Catch the witness
Catch the wit
Catch the spirit

The world is the world is
Love and life are deep

If I really coulda hung the moon
Would you change your mind
If I could cry a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses

To lose something that you cant have again

All That Remains,Two Weeks,"And you neglected I called you out
Dont please

You resurrected mistakes
Years past it seemed
And they exist to still haunt you


And still you feel like the loneliness
Is better replaced by this
I dont believe it this way
And I can see the fear in your eyes
Ive seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day


I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly I can hear you say
Dont leave dont give up on me
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember dont lie to me
You couldnt see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you


I wanted nothing but for that trust again
And brick by brick you would take it
You feared of phantoms and none exist but you
You still saw fit to destroy it

And still you feel like the loneliness
Is better replaced by this
I dont believe it this way
And I can see the fear in your eyes

Jennifer Nettles,Unlove You,"I could break down and cry
Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why
This just wont work
Itll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I dont
And maybe one day I wont
But for how hard Ive tried


I cant unlove you
And a heart cant unbreak
I cant unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I cant unknow this
Lord I wish I knew how
But I cant unlove you
So come love me for now


If I were 25
I know just what Id do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few
But we have other lives
And we know it aint right
This is going nowhere
If Im with you I dont care
Take me nowhere tonight

They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
With the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasnt lost until you found me


And I cant unlove you
And a heart cant unbreak
I cant unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I cant unknow this
Lord I wish I knew how
But I cant unlove you

But what about those who cant they will have to stay

Scratching at the walls imprisoned in this state of mind
Brought into life with no hope in sight
Scratching at the walls of my new found home the paint sits deep under my nails
A constant reminder of the attempts ive madeTo escape from this place to free myself from pain
To loosen these chains
To escape from this place to free myself from pain
To rid my heart of hate Rid my life of hate
My mind an empty room with no windows to see through
Isolated from the truthfrom the truth
Do my eyes deceive me by what they have not seen
Freedom the one desire that will never ceaseThere must be more to this life of mine
There is something deep inside that testifies of a greater kind
I cannot simply reach out for something better
I sit here incapable of such a feat predetermined defeat
Unable to see past these walls around me

Isolated from the truthfrom the truth
Do my eyes deceive me by what they have not seen

Back to the same old place Memphis Tennessee


Early one morning just about
Half past three
You done something thats really
Worrying me


Come on
Take a little walk with me
To the same old place where we long to be


Lets talk a walk out on the old avenue
I have got something for you to do

Come on baby
Take a little walk with me
To the same old place where we long to be


Come on baby now you know we going to walk so slow
Until every time you see me youll want to walk some more


Come on baby
Take a little walk with me
To the same old place where we long to be",blues

The Color Morale,Walls,"I feel at home with shadows from ghosts of the living
I dance along to melodies as silent choirs sing
Im sick of always giving when theres nothing left to lose
This place were in is breaking its trying to break me too


I built these walls to keep the outside world from me
And Ill fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
Its safer on the inside
Underneath where you cant ever get to me
And Ill fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
Its safer on the inside


Built these walls its safer on the inside
Built these walls its safer on the inside


Chaos reigns inside of all of us
All this pain its not where I belong
Its not my fate and youre a hypocrite
Youre the dying proof of it now I know
Broken people just like you can be so dangerous
Knowing youll survive by feeding off the rest of us

I built these walls to keep the outside world from me
And Ill fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
Its safer on the inside
Underneath where you cant ever get to me
And Ill fight to stay in the hell of my own mind

The Ghost Inside,Wash It Away,"I lay awake trapped in the same routine repeating over and over
I look ahead and I start to feel the dread of growing older and older
So whats it gonna take to finally make a change
Im shaking like an earthquake


Its been building up and become too much
Like the pouring rain we can wash it away
When youve had enough and it starts to flood
We can break like a tidal wave and wash it away


I hear the wind
A storm is moving in its getting closer and closer
For all these days Ive been my own barricade Im not afraid anymore
So watch me break at the shore


Its been building up and become too much
Like the pouring rain we can wash it away
When youve had enough and it starts to flood
We can break like a tidal wave and wash it away

Tracy Byrd,Watermelon Crawl,"I was drivin through Georgia in late July
On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin in red
Rhine county watermelon festival ahead


Well I wasnt in a hurry so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party goin on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor


He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl


When the band started playin the watermelon queen
Said let me show you somethin that you aint never seen
She grabbed me by the arm said come on lets go
She dipped down spun around and docedoed


She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
She crawled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
She said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

She said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl


If youre ever down in Georgia around about July
If you aint in a hurry then you oughta stop by
I can guarantee that youre goin have a ball
Learnin how to do the watermelon crawl


Well we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink dont drive do the watermelon crawl
Yeah do the watermelon crawl
Have fun you all

But I dont wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die

We cant be friends
But Id like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again


Wait for your love

Me and my truth we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl its just me and you
Cause I dont wanna argue but I dont wanna bite

Know that you made me
I dont like how you paint me yet Im still here hanging
Not what you made me
Its somethin like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now its only me
And maybe thats all I need


We cant be friends
But Id like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

So that you could have the good

And I couldnt tell was it just the wind
Or was she mad again  ah hell
Shes gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounded like Im gone
But these days gone can mean so many things


Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish shed been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here


Well its gettin dark out she aint back yet
Aint called home turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her when she went to leave
But I didnt cause I didnt really think what Im thinkin now
Im still not sure what gone is all about

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish shed been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here


Is it the kind of gone where shes at her moms cooling down
Shell come around or the kind that says you had your chance
And she aint comin back


Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish shed been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life

Dierks Bentley,What Was I Thinkin',"Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a ninepound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking


Oh I knew thered be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was


Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking what was I thinking


By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in fourwheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking

When a mountain of a man with a born to kill tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hoodsliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddys in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking oh what was I thinking oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a comeandgetme grin
And like a bullet we were gone again cause I was

I work the pen to make the ink transform
On any particular surface the pen lands on
Zaakir is hands on whats the beef
The Cooley High Cochise high post techniques
I drape off poetic landscapes and shapes
Illustrate the paper space off the pens that paint
Then design what have a National Geographic a magic
With tailormade status and plus flavor thats automatic

Melancholy mundane so I tame the hot flame
Big rings fat chains and yall quest for the same
No name use fame strictly new to the thang
We stay true to the game and never bring it to shame
We tight like dreadlocks or Redd Foxx and ripple
We pass participles and smash the artist in you
The saga continues this I wont get into
Cause there aint enough bars to hold the drama that we been through

Yo
We still the same with a little fame
A little change in the household name but aint too much changed
We in the game yo but not to be vain
I refrain from salt grains to season up my name
We entertain for a mutual game from close range
Steady aim I drum at your head to hit the brain
Im labor ready Rhode Scholar for the dollar
Work for mines pay me by the hour


Were not balling
We take it back to the days of yes yallin

Yo

Sick of phony mobsters controllin the dance floor

Some of you bum a few cheers from shock value
Word power can plow through acres of cornfields
Paragraphs cut like warm steel perform ill

Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you dont say a thing


The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
Theres a truth in your eyes saying youll never leave me
A touch of your hand says youll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all


All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mister Webster could never define
Whats being said between your heart and mine


The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
Theres a truth in your eyes saying youll never leave me
A touch of your hand says youll catch me if ever I fall

Killed a mile and half from here what happened to him

And his body has never been found

Verb T,Where You Find Me,"Leave me alone Leave me alone
Leave me alone so just leave me alone
I said leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone
Im not in the mood piss off


So when I say leave me alone
Nah T dont play
Im like Michael Jackson
In a non pedo way
The thought of mad partyin debauchery
Tortures me my tshirt reads
Fuck off and dont talk to me
Approaching every situation awkwardly
Like Im mesmerized under some sort of sorcery
Whos calling me Dunno Ill ignore it G
If I dont share my time
Then is there more for me
Id rather stay reclusive making music
Getting tipsy after one or maybe two drinks
A lightweight my mind state migrates
Walking through the club a little slowly
With a light haze
Deny pain rocking shows with a migraine
People I aim to avoid kinda like plagues
Not really Im a people person
Im just boring as fuck and thats the major reason
Ts a hermit

Im home alone I dont wanna let em in
I dont want cocaine I dont want ketamine
You can have it all there have a great night please
Chillin in my house on the couchs where youll find me

Where you find me wh where youll find me
Where you find me wh where youll find me
Where youll find me wh where youll find me
Man Ive been chillin in my yard since the 90s


Standing in solitude running out of rocket fuel
Trapped on a strange planet tryna get a proper view
Youtube surfin download free shit
Get my rhyme book out play a couple beats quick
Something in the oven drinks in the fridge
Chillin with the missus she thinks Im a prick
Not really
But I am a massive idiot
Barely ever leave my chair like a paraplegic
Now Im leaving only to the shop though
Agoraphobic shit and it dont stop yo
Crowd of people in the street looking like zombies
Im pale as a sheet people like
Whats wrong T
I dunno Im feeling dizzy as a stupid fuck
Tryna scramble home
Nearly walked into a moving bus
As I get to my house I feel relieved
Walk in and triple lock the doors behind me

Brad Paisley,Whiskey Lullaby (feat. Alison Krauss),"She put him out
Like the burnin end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night


He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said Ill love her til I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby


Lalalalalalala lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala lalalalalalala


The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night

We laid her next to him beneath the willow

Counterparts,Whispers of Your Death,"Begging from the floor
As you stare in the face of starvation
Sacrifice myself to secure your safety
I choked on the taste of tears
Til both of my eyes ran dry
Refusing to believe false prophets
That claimed you would not survive


Its hard to breathe without you sleeping on my chest
Sick and withering from the whispers of your death
Forever your saviour as much as you are mine
And for that I promise to protect you
Until the day I die


Clinging to what little you had come with
Until my fingernails scratchd through to bone
Collapsing in arms of uncertainty
Knowing I could nevr let you go


Tearing out whats left of my insides
To spare you from your sickness
I promise to protect you
Until the day I die

Make your cancer mine
Make your cancer mine


Its hard to breathe without you sleeping on my chest
Sick and withering from the whispers of your death
Forever your saviour as much as you are mine
And for that I promise to protect you
Until the day I die

But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight


I keep waiting Cant wait ooh until that day
I keep on waiting
But it aint easy Love dont come easy
It aint easy but Mama said
You cant hurry love Ooh until that day
No you just have to wait
She said Trust give it time Love dont come easy
No matter how long it takes
You cant hurry love Ooh until that day
No you just have to wait
She said love dont come easy3",disco
Art Pepper,You Go To My Head,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Cant you see that it never can be

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though Im certain that this heart of mine
Hasnt a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",jazz
Mississippi Fred McDowell,You Gotta Move,"Kristy finally sold a painting
So we decided to drive to the outsider blues fest in Toronto
We packed a coupla bags and left bright and early
Once we got outta town I put on some Mississippi Fred McDowell
Kristy said Dont you think well be hearing enough blues this weekend
So I played Sticky Fingers and I sang along to each word of each song
Kristy drove with two fingers on the steering wheel drummin
I skipped you gotta move  Kristy asked why I said I thought you said I thought you said no blues
The pills we had taken were kickin in
Ive never seen my own heart  we never see our own hearts thats the truly weird part
Cant asses any damage or survey the scars
But I see through the trees some place Ive never known and I wont live to see
Theres simply too many other places to get to
But one day Ill quit thinking so much Ill quit moving around and plan a flag in this ground
Thats a difference you know you can really feel
I guess you cant own it  like sometimes you get lucky with a straight flush with no wilds
The you gotta say  Alright fellas come on now lets all put away the guns
But after the darkness theres a light
After the darkness theres light
Outsider blues
And a parking lot shot through the pain pills and booze
Kristy kept bumping me with her hip and smiling
I might have felt like I was saved then
But I know what I feels just one version of real
If theres one thing that can not be taught
Its belief
Outsider blues with little to lose
Outsider blues with little to lose",blues

Ill never find the words my love
To tell you how I feel my love

Suicide Silence,You Only Live Once,"Push your care push your burdens aside
Erase everything inside and leave
Just one thing on your mind


You only live once so just go fucking nuts
Muah go


Live life hard
Live life hard


You only get one shot so shoot


With every breath you take youre dying
With every step we take were falling apart
If we only had one chance wed breathe
So lets take the chance right now and scream

You only live one life for a very short time
So make every second divine

Go Live life hard
Live life hard


Are you still breathing
Its your heart thats beating inside that keeps us alive
And for the very first time were pushing aside
To surrender everything that I see in my eyes


Except for the one thing on my mind
That I am alive For the very first time


For the first time pushing worry aside
For the first time pushing worry aside


Erase everything inside

And leave just one thing

Aaron Tippin,You've Got to Stand for Something,"Now Daddy didnt like trouble but if it came along
Everyone that knew him knew which side that hed be on
He never was a hero or this countys shinin light
But you could always find him standing up
For what he thought was right


Hed say youve got to stand for something or youll fall for anything
Youve got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise whats right and uphold your family name
Youve got to stand for something or youll fall for anything




Now we might have been better off or owned a bigger house
If Daddy had done more givin in or a little more backing down
But we always had plenty just living his advice
Whatever you do today youll have to sleep with tonight


Hed say youve got to stand for something or youll fall for anything
Youve got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise whats right and uphold your family name
Youve got to stand for something or youll fall for anything

Now I know that things are different than they were in Daddys days
But I still believe what makes a man really hasnt changed


Youve got to stand for something or youll fall for anything

Never compromise whats right and uphold your family name
